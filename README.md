Welcome back, everyone! Today, we're starting an exciting project: a Ducati website clone where users can buy bikes and admins can manage the inventory. We'll be using the MERN stack for this project, which includes MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.

### Project Overview

We'll build a website with two main roles: users and admins. Users can browse and purchase bikes, while admins can manage the bike inventory. Let’s dive into the details.

### Roles and Permissions

1. **User Role**
   - Browse bikes
   - View bike details
   - Add bikes to cart
   - Purchase bikes
   - View order history

2. **Admin Role**
   - Add new bikes to the inventory
   - Edit bike details
   - Delete bikes from the inventory
   - View all orders

### Flow Explanation

#### Home Page
The home page will display a list of bikes. Users can browse the bikes and click on any bike to view its details. We'll also include navigation links to login/register, cart, and the admin dashboard for admins.

#### User Authentication
We'll create a login and registration page where users can create an account or log in. We'll implement authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to ensure secure access.

#### Bike Details Page
When a user clicks on a bike from the home page, they'll be taken to the bike details page. Here, we'll display detailed information about the bike and include an "Add to Cart" button.

#### Cart Page
The cart page will show all bikes added to the cart by the user. Users can adjust quantities or remove items from the cart. We'll also implement a checkout process to complete the purchase.

#### Order History Page
This page will display a list of all past orders for the logged-in user. Users can view the details and status of each order.

#### Admin Dashboard
The admin dashboard is accessible only to users with the admin role. Here, admins can:
- Manage Bikes: Add, edit, and delete bikes from the inventory.
- View Orders: Display all orders placed by users and update order statuses.

### Backend Flow

1. **User Authentication**
   We'll set up routes for user registration and login. JWT will be used for secure authentication and authorization.

2. **Bike Management (Admin)**
   We'll create routes for admins to add, update, and delete bikes. Middleware will be implemented to check the admin role before allowing access to these routes.

3. **Bike Browsing (User)**
   We'll set up routes to get a list of bikes and fetch details of a specific bike.

4. **Cart Management**
   We'll implement routes to add bikes to the cart, update quantities, and remove bikes from the cart. We'll use session or database to store cart data.

5. **Order Processing**
   We'll create routes for users to place orders and save order details in the database. Admin routes will be implemented to view and manage all orders.

### Frontend Flow

1. **Home Page Component**
   We'll fetch and display a list of bikes from the backend. This component will also include links to bike details, cart, and the admin dashboard.

2. **Authentication Components**
   We'll create login and registration forms to handle authentication and store JWT tokens in local storage.

3. **Bike Details Component**
   This component will fetch and display detailed information about a bike and implement the "Add to Cart" functionality.

4. **Cart Component**
   We'll display all items in the cart, handle updates to item quantities, and implement checkout functionality.

5. **Order History Component**
   This component will fetch and display the user's order history.

6. **Admin Components**
   - **Manage Bikes Component**: A form to add and edit bikes, and a list to display and delete bikes.
   - **Order Management Component**: A list of all orders with options to update order statuses.

### Conclusion

To summarize, we’ll be building a Ducati website clone with two main roles: users and admins. Users can browse and purchase bikes, while admins can manage the bike inventory. This project will help you understand how to build a full-stack application using the MERN stack. Follow along, and feel free to ask questions as we go!
